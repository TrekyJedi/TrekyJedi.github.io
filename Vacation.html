<h1>Galaxys Edge at Hollywood Studios</h1>

<body>
    <p>In Hollywood Studios there is a certain exibit that I am particuarly fond of called Galaxys Edge. Galaxys Edge is
        a Star Wars themed park with several rides and charactes that are all based off of Star Wars. You get to build
        your own lightsaber (if you have enough money), "fight" the First Order, and feel like you are taking a step
        into an entirely different world. I have always been a massive fan of anything relating to space, so when I got
        introduced to Star Wars I obivously Fell in love with it. And ever since I found out about The existince of
        Galaxys Edge, I wanted to go there. I have been there once but I didn't get to do everything I wanted to do
        there.</p>

    <h1><u>Smugglers Run</u></h1>

    <p>Smugglers Run is one of the most Famous rides in Galaxys Edge. You get to fly the Melenium Falcon with a crew or
        fly solo. There is also a easter egg where if you press certain buttons in a certain order before the ride
        starts, you will get to ride with Chewbacca.</p>
