    <blockquote>
        <p><q>One fact has always remained constant:The Chiss must be approached from a position of strength and
                respect.
                One must have strength, for the Chiss will deal only with those capable of keeping their promises.
                One must have respect, for the Ciss must believe that those promeises will be kept. </q>â€• Passage from
            Mitth'raw'nuruodo's journal</p>
